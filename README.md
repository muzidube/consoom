# Consoom

Consoom is a media tracking site. I have found many sites for tracking movies/tv watched, books read etc but never one that combined everything in to one. Consoom combines tracking your movies/tv, books and games in to one platform.

## API's used

For the site I have made use of various sites and their API's:

Movies/TV: TMDB
Games: Rawg & IGDB
Books: Google Books and NYT

## Languages/Building Blocks

Javascript
HTML
CSS
Tailwind
Node.js
Express/Mongoose
MongoDB

## Usage

For now I will have the site live for users to make accounts and track their own media. If the site recieves heavy use I will think about scaling the database.
